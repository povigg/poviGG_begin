Cyber-Security is something i was looking into for a while now. After briefly exploring cloud, i made my decision to go back to CS by enrolling CS trainings at Vilnius coding school.

Following CCNA certification a while ago i was looking to get into CS field as a direction i want to go to, unfortunately my plan didn't work out. Since then a lot of changes happened, got some cloud experience working with AWS and Azure services and finally found a way to go back to CS. The good thing is that CS is just everywhere. It doesn't matter what company are you working for, are you using cloud or on-premisses equipment, everyone will need protection.

My name is Povilas and i'm ready for my next step. Cyber Security is wide and fasinating field.

I need will and dedication. These are simple things, just change your thinking.

Big kuddos goes to Madars, your thinking and advices are mind blowing, something what i need right now. Thanks for motivation.

Time for my first project, trying to "replicate Google". This is begging of coding for me also learning how to use GitHub :) Now i will create new repository for this project. See you there!
